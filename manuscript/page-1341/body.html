<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Of old our Apostles came to them with the proofs of their mission; then
verily after this most of them committed excesses in the land.</p><p>Only, the recompense of those who war against God and his Apostle, and go
about to commit disorders on the earth, shall be that they shall be slain or
crucified, or have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be banished the
land: This their disgrace in this world, and in the next a great torment
shall be theirs-</p><p>Except those who, ere you have them in your power, shall repent; for know
that God is Forgiving, Merciful.</p><p>O ye who believe! fear God. Desire union with Him. Contend earnestly on his
path, that you may attain to happiness.</p><p>As to the infidels-if that they had twice the riches of the earth to be their
ransom from torment on the day of resurrection, it should not be accepted
from them! And a dolorous torment shall be their's.</p></div> </div>
