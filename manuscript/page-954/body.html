said, "O our Lord! accept it from us; for thou art the Hearer, the Knower.</p><p>O our Lord! make us also Muslims, and our posterity a Muslim people; and
teach us our holy rites, and be turned towards us, for thou art He who
turneth, the Merciful.</p><p>O our Lord! raise up among them an apostle52 who may rehearse thy signs unto
them, and teach them 'the Book,' and Wisdom, and purify them: for thou art
the Mighty, the Wise."</p><p>And who but he that hath debased his soul to folly will mislike the faith of
Abraham, when we have chosen him in this world, and in the world to come he
shall be of the Just?</p><p>When his Lord said to him, "Resign thyself to me," he said, "I resign myself
to the Lord of the Worlds."</p></div> </div>
