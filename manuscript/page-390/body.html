our angels who are at their sides write them down.</p><p>SAY: If the God of Mercy had a son, the first would I be to worship him:</p><p>But far be the Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, the Lord of the Throne,
from that which they impute to Him!</p><p>Wherefore let them alone, to plunge on, and sport, until they meet the day
with which they are menaced.</p><p>He who is God in the Heavens is God in earth also: and He is the Wise, the
Knowing.</p><p>And Blessed be He whose is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth and of
all that is between them; for with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to
Him shall ye be brought back.</p></div> </div>
