authoritatively put forth by the Polish and German Talmudist Rabbins. "At the
first creation of Heaven and Earth . . . the throne of glory of the Blessed
God stood in the air above the waters." Comp. Ps. civ. 3.</p><p>4 Men, heaven, and earth. Comp. Tr. Aboth, v. Mischna 1.</p><p>5 Comp. verse 37 and Sura [xci.] ii. 21. It should be observed that the
challenge in these passages is not to produce a book which shall equal the
Koran in point of poetry or rhetoric, but in the importance of its subject-
matter with reference to the Divine Unity, the future retribution, etc. Upon
these topics Muhammad well knew that he had preoccupied the ground. And we
may infer from the fragments of the Revelations of Musailima and Saj�h
(Hisam. 946; Attab�ri (ed. Kosegarten "i. 134, 136, 152; Tab. Ag�ni, 339)," "")</p><p>which are mere imitations of the Koran, that he felt this to be the case.</p></div> </div>
