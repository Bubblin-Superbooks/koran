yourselves; and ye shall not give but as seeking the face of God; and
whatever good thing ye shall have given in alms, shall be repaid you, and ye
shall not be wronged. There are among you the poor, who being shut up to
fighting for the cause of God, have it not in their power to strike out into
the earth for riches. Those who know them not, think them rich because of
their modesty. By this their token thou shalt know them-they ask not of men
with importunity: and of whatever good thing ye shall give them in alms, of a
truth God will take knowledge.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">They who give away their substance in alms, by night and day, in private and
in public, shall have their reward with their Lord: no fear shall come on
