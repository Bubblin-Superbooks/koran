<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">find mercy:</p><p>And vie in haste for pardon from your Lord, and a Paradise, vast as the
Heavens and the Earth, prepared for the God-fearing.</p><p>Who give alms, alike in prosperity and in success, and who master their
anger, and forgive others! God loveth the doers of good.</p><p>They who, after they have done a base deed or committed a wrong against their
own selves, remember God and implore forgiveness of their sins-and who will
forgive sins but God only?-and persevere not in what they have wittingly done
amiss.</p><p>As for these! Pardon from their Lord shall be their recompense, and gardens
'neath which the rivers flow; for ever shall they abide therein: And goodly
the reward of those who labour!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Already, before your time, have examples been made! Traverse the earth, then,
and see what hath been the end</p></div> </div>
