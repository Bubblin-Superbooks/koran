<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it.</p><p>Surely, among delights shall the righteous dwell!</p><p>Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around;</p><p>Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight;</p><p>Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff,</p><p>The seal of musk. For this let those pant who pant for bliss-</p><p>Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim-2</p><p>Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink.</p><p>The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn:</p><p>And when they pass by them they wink at one another,-</p><p>And when they return to their own people, they return jesting,</p><p>And when they see them they say, "These are the erring ones."</p></div> </div>
