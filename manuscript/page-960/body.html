<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>And we sent to you an apostle from among yourselves to rehearse our signs
unto you, and to purify you, and to instruct you in "the Book," and in the
wisdom, and to teach you that which ye knew not:</p><p>Therefore remember me: I will remember you; and give me thanks and be not
ungrateful.</p><p>O ye who believe! seek help with patience and with prayer, for God is with
the patient.</p><p>And say not of those who are slain on God's path61 that they are Dead; nay,
they are Living! But ye understand not.</p><p>With somewhat of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth, and lives, and fruits,
will we surely prove you: but bear good tidings to the patient,</p><p>Who when a mischance chanceth them, say, "Verily we are God's, and to Him
shall we return:"62</p><p>On them shall be blessings from their Lord, and mercy: and these!-they are
the rightly guided.</p></div> </div>
