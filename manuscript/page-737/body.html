<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Without pillars that can be seen hath He created the heavens, and on the
earth hath thrown mountains lest it should move with you;5 and He hath
scattered over it animals of every sort: and from the Heaven we send down
rain and cause every kind of noble plant to grow up therein.</p><p>This is the creation of God: Shew me now what others than He have created.
Ah! the ungodly are in a manifest delusion.</p><p>Of old we bestowed wisdom upon LOKMAN, and taught him thus-"Be thankful to
God: for whoever is thankful, is thankful to his own behoof; and if any shall
be thankless . . .  God truly is self-sufficient, worthy of all praise!"</p><p>And bear in mind when Lokman said to his son by way of warning, "O my son!
join not other gods with God, for the joining gods with God is the great
impiety."</p></div> </div>
