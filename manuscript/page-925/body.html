refusal of the Meccans at Hudaibiya to adopt the formula prescribed by
Muhammad-In the Name of the God of Mercy, the Merciful-declaring that they
knew not who the God of Mercy (Arrahman "was. This was in Hej. 6. See n. p." "")</p><p>173.</p><p>5 Lit. despair.</p><p>6 That is, the Jews, who at this period of Muhammad's prophetic function,
must have been highly gratified at the strong leaning towards, and respect
for, their Scriptures and Histories, which shews itself increasingly in the
later Meccan Suras.</p><p>7 Lit. Mother, or Prototype of the Book. Either God's knowledge or
Prescience, or the fabled preserved tablet, on which is written the original
of the Koran, and all God's decrees. The Jews have a tradition that the Law
existed before the Creation. Midr. Jalkut, 7.</p></div> </div>
