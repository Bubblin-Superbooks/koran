trust in their Lord;</p><p>And who avoid the heinous things of crime, and filthiness, and when they are
angered, forgive;</p><p>And who hearken to their Lord, and observe prayer, and whose affairs are
guided by mutual COUNSEL, and who give alms of that with which we have
enriched them;</p><p>And who, when a wrong is done them, redress themselves:</p><p>-Yet let the recompense of evil be only a like evil but he who forgiveth and
