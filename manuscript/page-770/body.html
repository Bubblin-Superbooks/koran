lie on the part of God? Truly God is full of bounties to man; but most of
them give not thanks.</p><p>Thou shalt not be employed in affairs, nor shalt thou read a text out of the
Koran, nor shall ye work any work, but we will be witnesses over you when ye
are engaged therein: and not the weight of an atom on Earth or in Heaven
escapeth thy Lord; nor is there aught that is less than this or greater, but
it is in the perspicuous Book.</p><p>Are not the friends of God, those on whom no fear shall come, nor shall they
be put to grief?</p><p>They who believe and fear God-</p><p>For them are good tidings in this life, and in the next! There is no change
in the words of God! This, the great felicity!</p><p>And let not their discourse grieve thee: for all might is God's: the Hearer,
the Knower, He!</p></div> </div>
