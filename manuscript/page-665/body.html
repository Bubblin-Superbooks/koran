on that day! Verily, God will be swift to reckon.</p><p>Warn them, then, of the approaching day, when men's hearts shall rise up,
choking them, into their throats.</p><p>The evil-doers shall have no friend or intercessor who shall prevail.</p><p>God knoweth the deceitful of eye, and what men's breasts conceal.</p><p>And everything will God decide with truth: But nothing shall those gods whom
men call on beside him, decide. Verily, God! the Hearer, the Beholder, He!</p><p>Have they never journeyed in this land, and seen what hath been the end of
those who flourished before them? Mightier were they in strength than these
Meccans, and their traces remain in the land: Yet God took them in their
sins, and there was none to defend them against God.</p></div> </div>
