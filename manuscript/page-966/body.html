for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the woman for the woman: but

equitably; and to him should he pay a fine with liberality.</p><p>This is a relaxation69 from your Lord and a mercy. For him who after his
shall transgress,70 a sore punishment!</p><p>But in this law of retaliation is your security for life, O men of
understanding! to the intent that ye may fear God.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It is prescribed to you, when any one of you is at the point of death, if he
leave goods, that he bequeath equitably to his parents and kindred. This is
binding on those who fear God. But as for him who after he hath heard the
bequest shall change it, surely the wrong of this shall be on those who
change it: verily, God</p></div> </div>
