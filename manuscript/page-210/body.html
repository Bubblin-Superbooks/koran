<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful</p><p>A SUITOR sued1 for punishment to light suddenly</p><p>On the infidels: none can hinder</p><p>God from inflicting it, the master of those ASCENTS,</p><p>By which the angels and the spirit ascend to him in a day, whose length is
fifty thousand years.2</p><p>Be thou patient therefore with becoming patience;</p><p>They forsooth regard that day as distant,</p><p>But we see it nigh:</p><p>The day when the heavens shall become as molten brass,</p><p>And the mountains shall become like flocks of wool:</p><p>And friend shall not question of friend,</p><p>Though they look at one another. Fain would the wicked redeem himself from
punishment on that day at the price of his children,</p></div> </div>
