made it tortuous1</p><p>But direct; that it may warn of a grievous woe from him, and announce to the
faithful who do the things that are right, that a goodly reward, wherein they
shall abide for ever, awaiteth them;</p><p>And that it may warn those who say, "God hath begotten a Son."</p><p>No knowledge of this have either they or their fathers! A grievous saying to
come out of their mouths! They speak no other than a lie!</p><p>And haply, if they believe not in this new revelation, thou wilt slay
thyself, on their very footsteps, out of vexation.</p><p>Verily, we have made all that is on earth as its adornment, that we might
make trial who among mankind would excel in works:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But we are surely about to reduce all that is thereon</p></div> </div>
