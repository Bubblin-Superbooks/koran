with its guidance and light, confirmatory of the preceding Law; a guidance
and warning to those who fear God;-</p><p>And that the people of the Evangel may judge according to what God hath sent
down therein. And whoso will not judge by what God hath sent down-such are
the perverse.</p><p>And to thee we have sent down the Book of the Koran with truth, confirmatory
of previous Scriptures, and their safeguard. Judge therefore between them by
what God hath sent down, and follow not their desires by deserting the truth
which hath come unto thee. To every one of you have we given a rule and a
beaten track.</p><p>And if God had pleased He had surely made you all one people; but He would
test you by what He hath given to each. Be emulous, then, in good deeds. To
God shall ye all return, and He will tell you concerning the subjects of your
disputes.</p></div> </div>
