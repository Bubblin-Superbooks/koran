ye have no other God than He: will ye not therefore fear Him?"</p><p>And the chiefs of His people who believed not, and who deemed the meeting
with us in the life to come to be a lie, and whom we had richly supplied in
this present life, said, "This is but a man like yourselves; he eateth of
what ye eat,</p><p>And he drinketh of what ye drink:</p><p>And if ye obey a man like yourselves, then ye will surely be undone.</p><p>What! doth he foretell you, that after ye shall be dead and become dust and
bones, ye shall be brought forth?</p><p>Away, away with his predictions!</p><p>There is no life beyond our present life; we die, and we live, and we shall
not be quickened again!</p></div> </div>
