the Heaven and the Earth? If such were our pleasure, we could sink them into
that Earth, or cause a portion of that Heaven to fall upon them! herein truly

birds answer his songs of praise." And we made the iron soft for him:-"Make
coats of mail, and arrange its plates; and work ye righteousness; for I
behold your actions."</p></div> </div>
