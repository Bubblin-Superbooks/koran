world and in the next! Cause thou me to die a Muslim, and join me with the

not present with Joseph's brethren when they conceived their design and laid
their plot: but the greater part of men, though thou long for it, will not

instruction for all mankind.</p><p>And many as are the signs in the Heavens and on the Earth, yet they will pass
them by, and turn aside from them:</p><p>And most of them believe not in God, without also joining other deities with
Him.</p><p>What! Are they sure that the overwhelming chastisement of God shall not come
upon them, or that that Hour shall not come upon them suddenly, while they
are unaware?</p></div> </div>
