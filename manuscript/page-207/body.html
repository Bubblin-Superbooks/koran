original word is also rendered, the Lote-Tree of the extremity, or of the
loftiest spot in Paradise, in the seventh Heaven, on the right hand of the
throne of God. Its leaves are fabled to be as numerous as the members of the
whole human family, and each leaf to bear the name of an individual. This
tree is shaken on the night of the 15th of Ramadan every year a little after
sunset, when the leaves on which are inscribed the names of those who are to
die in the ensuing year fall, either wholly withered, or with more or less
green remaining, according to the months or weeks the person has yet to live.</p><p>4 The Sidrah is a prickly plum, which is called Ber in India, the zizyphus
Jujuba of Linnï¿½us. A decoction of the leaves is used in India to wash the
dead, on account of the sacredness of the tree.</p></div> </div>
