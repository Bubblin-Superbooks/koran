wondrous signs?</p><p>When the youths betook them to the cave they said, "O our Lord! grant us
mercy from before thee, and order for us our affair aright."</p><p>Then struck we upon their ears with deafness in the cave for many a year:</p><p>Then we awaked them that we might know which of the two parties could best
