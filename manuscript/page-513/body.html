but, at most things is man a caviller.</p><p>And what, now that guidance is come to them, letteth men from believing and
from asking forgiveness of their Lord-unless they wait till that the doom of
the ancients overtake them, or the chastisement come upon them in the sight
of the universe?</p><p>We send not our Sent Ones but to announce and to warn: but the infidels cavil
with vain words in order to refute the truth; and they treat my signs and
their own warnings with scorn.</p><p>But who is worse than he who when told of the signs of his Lord turneth him
away and forgetteth what in time past his hands have wrought? Truly we have
thrown veils over their hearts lest they should understand this Koran, and
into their ears a heaviness:</p><p>And if thou bid them to "the guidance" yet will they not even then be guided
ever.</p></div> </div>
