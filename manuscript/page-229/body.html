creation? Aye, of coarse clay have we created them.</p><p>But while thou marvellest they mock;</p><p>When they are warned, no warning do they take;</p><p>And when they see a sign, they fall to mocking,</p><p>And say, "This is no other than clear sorcery:</p><p>What! when dead, and turned to dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised?</p><p>Our sires also of olden times?"</p><p>Say, Yes; and ye shall be covered with disgrace.</p><p>For, one blast only, and lo! they shall gaze around them, And shall say, "Oh!
woe to us! this is the day of reckoning; This is the day of decision which ye
gainsaid as an untruth."</p></div> </div>
