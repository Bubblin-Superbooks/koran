they who believe not say to the believers, "Shall we feed him whom God can
feed if He will?

they return.</p><p>And the trumpet shall be blown, and, lo! they shall speed out of their
sepulchres to their Lord:</p><p>They shall say, "Oh! woe to us! who hath roused us from our sleeping place?
'Tis what the God of Mercy promised; and the Apostles spake the truth."</p><p>But one blast shall there be,13 and, lo! they shall be assembled before us,
all together.</p></div> </div>
