bidding; but when they acted criminally therein, just was its doom, and we
destroyed it with an utter destruction.</p><p>And since Noah, how many nations have we exterminated! And of the sins of his
servants thy Lord is sufficiently informed, observant.</p><p>Whoso chooseth this quickly passing life, quickly will we bestow therein that

him, in which he shall burn-disgraced, outcast:</p><p>But whoso chooseth the next life, and striveth after it as it should be
striven for, being also a believer,-these! their striving shall be grateful
to God:</p></div> </div>
