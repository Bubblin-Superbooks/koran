<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Apostles charged to announce and to warn, that men, after those apostles,
might have no plea against God. And God is Mighty, Wise!</p><p>But God is himself witness of what He hath sent down to thee: In His
knowledge hath He sent it down to thee. The angels are also its witnesses:
but God is a sufficient witness!</p><p>Verily, they who believe not and pervert from the way of God, have indeed
erred with error wide of truth.</p><p>Verily, those who believe not, and act wrongfully, God will never pardon, and
never will he guide them on path,</p><p>Than the path to Hell, in which they shall abide for ever! And this is easy
for God.</p><p>O men! now hath an apostle come to you with truth from your Lord. Believe
then, it will be better for you. But if ye believe not, then, all that is in
the Heavens and the Earth is God's; and God is Knowing, Wise!</p></div> </div>
