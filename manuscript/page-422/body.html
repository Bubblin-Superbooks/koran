ourselves. Ask ye the people who are warned by Scriptures,2 if ye know it

live for ever.</p><p>Then made we good our promise to them; and we delivered them and whom we
pleased, and we destroyed the transgressors.</p><p>And now have we sent down to you "the book," in which is your warning: What,
will ye not then understand?</p><p>And how many a guilty city have we broken down, and raised up after it other
peoples:</p><p>And when they felt our vengeance, lo! they fled from it.</p><p>"Flee not," said the angels in mockery, "but come back to that wherein ye
revelled, and to your abodes! Questions will haply be put to you."</p></div> </div>
