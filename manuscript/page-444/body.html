partner hath He in his Empire! All things hath He created, and decreeing hath
decreed their destinies.</p><p>Yet have they adopted gods beside Him which have created nothing, but were
themselves created:</p><p>And no power have they over themselves for evil or for good, nor have they
power of death, or of life, or of raising the dead.</p><p>And the infidels say, "This Koran is a mere fraud of his own devising, and
others have helped him with it,2 who had come hither by outrage and lie."3</p><p>And they say, "Tales of the ancients that he hath put in writing! and they
were dictated to him morn and even."</p><p>SAY: He hath sent it down who knoweth the secrets of the Heavens and of the
Earth. He truly is the Gracious, the Merciful.</p></div> </div>
