their heads:</p><p>Before them have we set a barrier and behind them a barrier, and we have
shrouded them in a veil, so that they shall not see.</p><p>Alike is it to them if thou warn them or warn them not: they will not
believe.</p><p>Him only shalt thou really warn, who followeth the monition and feareth the
God of mercy in secret: him cheer with tidings of pardon, and of a noble
recompense.</p><p>Verily, it is We who will quicken the dead, and write down the works which
they have sent on before them, and the traces which they shall have left
behind them: and everything have we set down in the clear Book of our
decrees.3</p><p>Set forth to them the instance of the people of the city4 when the Sent Ones
came to it.</p></div> </div>
