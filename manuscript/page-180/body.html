strangers."</p><p>And he went apart to his family, and brought a fatted calf,</p><p>And set it before them. He said, "Eat ye not?"</p><p>And he conceived a fear of them. They said to him, "Fear not;" and announced
to him a wise son.</p><p>His wife came up with outcry: she smote her face and said, "What I, old and
barren!"</p><p>They said, "Thus saith thy Lord. He truly is the Wise, the Knowing."</p><p>Said he, "And what, O messengers, is your errand?"</p></div> </div>
