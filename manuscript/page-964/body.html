<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The infidels resemble him who shouteth aloud to one who heareth no more than
a call and cry! Deaf, Dumb, blind: therefore they have no understanding.</p><p>O ye who believe! eat of the good things with which we have supplied you, and
give God thanks if ye are His worshippers.</p><p>But that which dieth of itself, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that over
which any other name than that of God hath been invoked, is forbidden you.
But he who shall partake of them by constraint, without lust or wilfulness,
no sin shall be upon him. Verily God is Indulgent, Merciful.</p><p>They truly who hide the Scriptures which God hath sent down, and barter them
for a mean price-these shall swallow into their bellies nought but fire. God
will not speak to them, or assoil them, on the day of the Resurrection: and
theirs shall be a grievous torment.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">These are they who have bartered guidance for error,</p></div> </div>
