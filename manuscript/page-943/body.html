of your own people from their abodes; ye lent help against them with wrong

forbidden you to drive them out.36 Believe ye then part of the Book, and deny
part? But what shall be the meed of him among you who doth this, but shame in
this life? And on the day of the Resurrection they shall be sent to the most
cruel of torments, for God is not regardless of what ye do.</p><p>These are they who purchase this present life at the price of that which is
to come: their torment shall not be lightened, neither shall they be helped.</p></div> </div>
