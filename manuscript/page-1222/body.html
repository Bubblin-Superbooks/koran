if it be said to you, "Go ye back," then go ye back. This will be more

the supply of your needs: and God knoweth what ye do openly and what ye hide.</p><p>Speak unto the believers that they restrain their eyes and observe
continence. Thus will they be more pure. God is well aware of what they do.</p></div> </div>
