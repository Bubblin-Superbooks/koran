down upon you water from Heaven that he might thereby cleanse you, and cause
the pollution of Satan to pass from you, and that he might gird up your
hearts, and stablish your feet by it:</p><p>When thy Lord spake unto the angels, "I will be with you: therefore stablish
ye the faithful. I will cast a dread into the hearts of the infidels." Strike
off their heads then, and strike off from them every finger-tip.</p><p>This, because they have opposed God and his apostle: And whoso shall oppose
God and his apostle. . . .  Verily, God will be severe in punishment.</p><p>"This for you! Taste it then! and for the infidels is the torture of the
fire!"</p><p>O ye who believe! when ye meet the marshalled hosts of the infidels, turn not
your backs to them:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Whoso shall turn his back to them on that day, unless he turn aside to fight,
or to rally to some other</p></div> </div>
