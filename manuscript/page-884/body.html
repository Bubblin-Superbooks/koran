surrender ourselves to the Lord of the Worlds.</p><p>And observe ye the times of prayer, and fear ye God: for it is He to whom ye
shall be gathered.</p><p>And it is He who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, in truth, and when
He saith to a thing, "Be," it is.</p><p>His word is the truth: and His the kingdom, on the day when there shall be a
blast on the trumpet: He knoweth alike the unseen and the seen: and He is the
Wise, the Cognisant.</p><p>And remember when Abraham said to his father Azar,18 Takest thou images as
gods? Verily, I see that thou and thy people are in manifest error.</p><p>And thus did we shew Abraham the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth,19
that he might be stablished in knowledge.</p><p>And when the night overshadowed him, he beheld a star. "This," said he, "is
my Lord:" but when it set, he said, "I love not gods which set."</p></div> </div>
