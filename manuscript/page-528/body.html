reckon.2</p><p>This is He who knoweth the unseen and the seen; the Mighty, the Merciful,</p><p>Who hath made everything which he hath created most good; and began the
creation of man with clay;</p><p>Then ordained his progeny from germs of life,3 from sorry water:</p><p>Then shaped him, and breathed of His Spirit into him, and gave you hearing
and seeing and hearts: what little thanks do ye return!</p><p>And they say, "What! when we shall have lain hidden in the earth, shall we
become a new creation?"</p></div> </div>
