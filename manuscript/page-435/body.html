shall not be disowned: and surely will we write them down for him.</p><p>There is a ban on every city which we shall have destroyed, that they shall
not rise again,</p><p>Until a way is opened for Gog and Magog,23 and they shall hasten from every
high land,</p><p>And this sure promise shall draw on. And lo! the eyes of the infidels shall

it for ever.</p><p>Therein shall they groan; but nought therein shall they hear to comfort them.</p></div> </div>
