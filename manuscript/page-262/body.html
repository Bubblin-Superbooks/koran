and the people of Tobba,3 all gave the lie to their prophets: justly,
therefore, were the menaces inflicted.</p><p>Are we wearied out with the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard
to a new creation!4</p><p>We created man: and we know what his soul whispereth to him, and we are
closer to him than his neck-vein.</p><p>When the two angels charged with taking account shall take it, one sitting on
the right hand, the other on the left:</p><p>Not a word doth he utter, but there is a watcher with him ready to note it
down:</p><p>And the stupor of certain death cometh upon him: "This is what thou wouldst
have shunned"-</p><p>And there shall be a blast on the trumpet,-it is the threatened day!</p></div> </div>
