<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>21 Joseph is said by the Muhammadan commentators to have stolen an idol of
gold belonging to his mother's father, which he broke, that he might not
worship it. But this comment, as well as the text of the Koran, is probably
based upon some such tradition as that of Midr. Rabba, Par. 92, "He is a
thief and the son of a thief" (Comp. Gen. xxxi. 19)-spoken of Benjamin.</p><p>22 That is, that Joseph was still alive. Thus Midr. Tanchumah on Gen. xlii.
1.</p><p>23 Comp. Gen. xxvii. 27.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">24 Joseph's mother had long been dead. See Gen. xxxv. 19. But the object of
Muhammad was probably to bring the event into strict accordance with the
prediction of the dream. Gen. xxxvii. 10. Some, however, suppose that Bilhah
is here meant, and her appearance before Joseph is also asserted to be the
fulfilment of the dream by some of the Rabbins.</p></div> </div>
