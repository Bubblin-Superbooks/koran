Eternity,27 and the Kingdom that faileth not?"</p><p>And they both ate thereof, and their nakedness appeared to them, and they
began to sew of the leaves of the Garden to cover them, and Adam disobeyed
his Lord and went astray.</p><p>Afterwards his Lord chose him for himself, and was turned towards him, and
guided him.</p><p>And God said, "Get ye all down hence, the one of you a foe unto the other.
Hereafter shall guidance come unto you from me;</p><p>And whoso followeth my guidance shall not err, and shall not be wretched:</p><p>But whoso turneth away from my monition, his truly shall be a life of misery:</p><p>And We will assemble him with others on the day of Resurrection, blind."28</p></div> </div>
