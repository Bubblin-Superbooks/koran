Cognizant.</p><p>It is He who hath made the earth level for you: traverse then its broad
sides, and eat of what He hath provided.-Unto Him shall be the resurrection.</p><p>What! are ye sure that He who is in Heaven will not cleave the Earth beneath
you? And lo, it shall quake.</p><p>Or are ye sure that He who is in Heaven will not send against you a stone-
charged whirlwind? Then shall ye know what my warning meant!</p><p>And verily, those who flourish before you treated their prophets as liars:
and how grievous my wrath!</p><p>Behold they not the birds over their heads, outstretching and drawing in
their wings? None, save the God of Mercy, upholdeth them: for he regardeth
all things.</p><p>Who is he that can be as an army to you, to succour you, except the God of
Mercy? Truly, the infidels are in the merest delusion.</p></div> </div>
