meeting of the next life as lies, they shall be given over to the torment.</p><p>Glorify God therefore when ye reach the evening, and when ye rise at morn:</p><p>And to Him be praise in the Heavens and on the Earth; and at twilight, and
when ye rest at noon.</p><p>He bringeth forth the living out of the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead
out of the living: and He quickeneth the earth when dead. Thus is it that ye
too shall be brought forth.5</p><p>And one of his signs it is that He hath created you out of dust; then lo! ye
become men who spread themselves far and wide:</p><p>And one of his signs it is, that He hath created wives for you of your own
species,6 that ye may dwell with them, and hath put love and tenderness
between you. Herein truly are signs for those who reflect.</p></div> </div>
