of doom.</p><p>Ourselves have we created them, and strengthened their joints; and when we
please, with others like unto themselves will we replace them.</p><p>This truly is a warning: And whoso willeth, taketh the way to his Lord;</p><p>But will it ye shall not, unless God will it, for God is Knowing, Wise.</p><p>He causeth whom He will to enter into his mercy. But for the evil doers, He
hath made ready an afflictive chastisement.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
