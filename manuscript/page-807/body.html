gone then; one of the despised shalt thou be."</p><p>He said, "Respite me till the day when mankind shall be raised from the
dead."</p><p>He said, "One of the respited shalt thou be."</p><p>He said, "Now, for that thou hast caused me to err, surely in thy straight
path will I lay wait for them:</p><p>Then will I surely come upon them from before, and from behind, and from
their right hand, and from their left, and thou shalt not find the greater
