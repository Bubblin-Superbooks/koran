the Hour shall arrive, on that day shall the despisers6 perish.</p><p>And thou shalt see every nation KNEELING: to its own book shall every nation
be summoned:-ï¿½This day shall ye be repaid as ye have wrought.</p><p>This our Book will speak of you with truth: therein have we written down
whatever ye have done."</p><p>As to those who have believed and wrought righteously, into his mercy shall
their Lord cause them to enter. This shall be undoubted bliss!</p><p>But as to the Infidels-"Were not my signs recited to you? but ye proudly
scorned them, and became a sinful people."</p><p>And when it was said, "Verily the Promise of God is truth; and as to the
Hour, there is no doubt of it;" ye said, "We know not what the hour is-we
conceive it a mere conceit,-we have no assurance of it."</p></div> </div>
