days, and no weariness touched us.9</p><p>Wherefore put up with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord
before sunrise and before sunset:</p><p>And praise Him in the night: and perform the two final prostrations.</p><p>And list for the day whereon the crier shall cry from a place near to every
one alike:</p><p>The day on which men shall in truth hear that shout will be the day of their
coming forth from the grave.</p><p>Verily, we cause to live, and we cause to die. To us shall all return.</p><p>On the day when the earth shall swiftly cleave asunder over the dead, will
this gathering be easy to Us.</p><p>We know best what the infidels say: and thou art not to compel them.</p><p>Warn then by the Koran those who fear my menace.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
