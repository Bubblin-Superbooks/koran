will not believe.</p><p>Who is guilty of a greater injustice than he who inventeth a lie concerning
God? They shall be set before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say, "These
are they who made their Lord a liar." Shall not the malison of God be on
these unjust doers,</p><p>Who pervert others from the way of God, and seek to make it crooked, and
believe not in a life to come? God's power on earth they shall not weaken;
and beside God they have no protector! Doubled shall be their punishment!
They were not able to hearken, and they could not see.</p><p>These are they who have lost their own souls, and the deities of their own
devising have vanished from them:</p><p>There is no doubt but that in the next world they shall be the lost ones.</p></div> </div>
