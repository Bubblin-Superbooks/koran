of which the third is the latest in point of style, and the second, more
detailed than is usual in the Suras of the early period, which allude to
Jewish and other legend only in brief and vague terms. It may therefore be
considered as one of the short and early Suras.</p><p>2 Or, By those angels which precede, i.e., the souls of the pious into
Paradise. Or, are beforehand with the Satans and djinn in learning the
decrees of God.</p><p>SURA LXXVII.-THE SENT [XXXVI.]</p><p>MECCA.-50 Verses</p><p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful</p><p>By the train of THE SENT ones,1</p><p>And the swift in their swiftness;</p><p>By the scatterers who scatter,</p><p>And the distinguishers who distinguish;</p></div> </div>
