come:-</p><p>These rest on guidance from their Lord, and with these it shall be well.</p><p>But a man there is4 who buyeth an idle tale, that in his lack of knowledge he
may mislead others from the way of God, and turn it to scorn. For such is
prepared a shameful punishment!</p><p>And when our signs are rehearsed to him, he turneth away disdainfully, as
though he heard them not,-as though his ears were heavy with deafness.
Announce to him therefore tidings of an afflictive punishment!</p><p>But they who shall have believed and wrought good works, shall enjoy the
gardens of delight:</p><p>For ever shall they dwell therein: it is God's true promise! and He is the
Mighty, the Wise.</p></div> </div>
