present chastisement, or whether it be "the Hour," and they shall then know
which is in the worse state, and which the more weak in forces:</p><p>But God will increase the guidance of the already guided.</p><p>And good works which abide, are in thy Lord's sight better in respect of
guerdon, and better in the issue than all worldly good.</p><p>Hast thou marked him who believeth not in our signs, and saith, "I shall
surely have riches and children bestowed upon me?"</p><p>Hath he mounted up into the secrets of God? Hath he made a compact with the
God of Mercy?</p><p>No! we will certainly write down what he saith, and will lengthen the length
of his chastisement:</p><p>And we will inherit what he spake of, and he shall come before us all alone.</p></div> </div>
