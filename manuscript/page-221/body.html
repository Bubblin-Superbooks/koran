almost exclusively to be found in Suras written at a time when Muhammad had
only a single wife of 60 years of age, and that in all the ten years
subsequent to the Hejira, women are only twice mentioned as part of the
reward of the faithful. Suras ii. 23 and iv. 60. While in Suras xxxvi. 56;
xliii. 70; xiii. 23; xl. 8 the proper wives of the faithful are spoken of as
accompanying their husbands into the gardens of bliss.</p><p>SURA LIV.-THE MOON [XLIX.]</p><p>MECCA.-55 Verses</p><p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful</p><p>The hour hath approached and the MOON hath been cleft:</p><p>But whenever they see a miracle they turn aside and say, This is well-devised
