aside.</p><p>Every fresh warning that cometh to them from their Lord they only hear to
mock it,-</p><p>Their hearts set on lusts: and they who have done this wrong say in secret
discourse, "Is He more than a man like yourselves? What! will ye, with your
eyes open,1 accede to sorcery?"</p><p>SAY: "My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and on the earth: He is
the Hearer, the Knower."</p><p>"Nay," say they, "it is the medley of dreams: nay, he hath forged it: nay, he
is a poet: let him come to us with a sign as the prophets of old were sent."</p><p>Before their time, none of the cities which we have destroyed, believed: will
these men, then, believe?</p></div> </div>
