day to come in upon the night? and that he hath subjected the sun and the
moon to laws by which each speedeth along to an appointed goal? and that God
therefore is acquainted with that which ye do?</p><p>This, for that God is the truth; and that whatever ye call upon beside Him is
a vain thing; and that God-He is the High, the Great.</p><p>Seest thou not how the ships speed on in the sea, through the favour of God,
that he may shew you of his signs? for herein are signs to all patient,
grateful ones.</p><p>When the waves cover them like dark shadows they call upon God as with
sincere religion; but when He safely landeth them, some of them there are who
halt between two opinions.11 Yet none reject our signs but all deceitful,
ungrateful ones.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">O men! fear ye your Lord, and dread the day</p></div> </div>
