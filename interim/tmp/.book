  "page-10": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">THE Koran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious\nbooks of the world. Though the youngest of the epoch-making works belonging\nto this class of literature, it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect\nwhich it has produced on large masses of men. It has created an all but new\nphase of human thought and a fresh type of character. It first transformed a\nnumber of heterogeneous desert tribes of the Arabian peninsula into a nation\nof heroes, and then proceeded to create the vast politico-religious\norganisations of the Muhammedan world which are one of the great forces</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with\nwhich Europe and the East have to reckon to-day.</p><p>The secret of the power exercised by the book, of course, lay in the mind\nwhich produced it. It was, in fact, at first not a book, but a strong living\nvoice, a kind of wild authoritative proclamation, a series of admonitions,\npromises, threats, and instructions addressed to turbulent and largely\nhostile assemblies of untutored Arabs. As a book it was published after the\nprophet's death. In Muhammed's life-time there were only disjointed notes,\nspeeches, and the retentive memories of those who listened to them. To speak\nof the Koran is, therefore, practically the same as speaking of Muhammed, and\nin trying to appraise the religious value of the book one is at the same time\nattempting to form an opinion of the prophet himself. It would indeed be\ndifficult to find another case in which there is such a complete identity\nbetween the literary work and the mind of the man who produced it.</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That widely different estimates have been formed of Muhammed is well-known.\nTo Moslems he is, of course, the prophet par excellence, and the Koran is\nregarded by the orthodox as nothing less than the eternal utterance of Allah.\nThe eulogy pronounced by Carlyle on Muhammed in Heroes and Hero Worship will\nprobably be endorsed by not a few at the present day. The extreme contrary\nopinion, which in a fresh form has recently been revived1 by an able writer,\nis hardly likely to find much lasting support. The correct view very probably\nlies between the two extremes. The relative value of any given system of\nreligious thought must depend on the amount of truth which it embodies as\nwell as on the ethical standard which its adherents are bidden to follow.\nAnother important test is the degree of originality that is to be assigned to\nit, for it can manifestly only claim credit for that which is new in it, not\nfor that which it borrowed from other</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">systems.</p><p>With regard to the first-named criterion, there is a growing opinion among\nstudents of religious history that Muhammed may in a real sense be regarded\nas a prophet of certain truths, though by no means of truth in the absolute\nmeaning of the term. The shortcomings of the moral teaching contained in the\nKoran are striking enough if judged from the highest ethical standpoint with\nwhich we are acquainted; but a much more favourable view is arrived at if a\ncomparison is made between the ethics of the Koran and the moral tenets of\nArabian and other forms of heathenism which it supplanted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The method followed by Muhammed in the promulgation of the Koran also\nrequires to be treated with discrimination. From the first flash of prophetic\ninspiration which is clearly discernible in the earlier portions of the book\nhe, later on, frequently descended</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to deliberate invention and artful\nrhetoric. He, in fact, accommodated his moral sense to the circumstances in\nwhich the r\\oc\\le he had to play involved him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On the question of originality there can hardly be two opinions now that the\nKoran has been thoroughly compared with the Christian and Jewish traditions\nof the time; and it is, besides some original Arabian legends, to those only\nthat the book stands in any close relationship. The matter is for the most\npart borrowed, but the manner is all the prophet's own. This is emphatically\na case in which originality consists not so much in the creation of new\nmaterials of thought as in the manner in which existing traditions of various\nkinds are utilised and freshly blended to suit the special exigencies of the\noccasion. Biblical reminiscences, Rabbinic legends, Christian traditions\nmostly drawn from distorted apocryphal sources, and native heathen stories,\nall first pass through the prophet's fervid mind,</p>",

The Koran enjoys the distinction of\nhaving been the starting-point of a new literary and philosophical movement\nwhich has powerfully affected the finest and most cultivated minds among both\nJews and Christians in the Middle Ages. This general progress of the\nMuhammedan world has somehow been arrested, but research has shown that what\nEuropean scholars knew of Greek philosophy, of mathematics, astronomy, and\nlike sciences, for several centuries before the Renaissance, was, roughly\nspeaking, all derived from Latin treatises ultimately based on Arabic\noriginals; and</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it was the Koran which, though indirectly, gave the first\nimpetus to these studies among the Arabs and their allies. Linguistic\ninvestigations, poetry, and other branches of literature, also made their\nappearance soon after or simultaneously with the publication of the Koran;\nand the literary movement thus initiated has resulted in some of the finest\nproducts of genius and learning.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The style in which the Koran is written requires some special attention in\nthis introduction. The literary form is for the most part different from\nanything else we know. In its finest passages we indeed seem to hear a voice\nakin to that of the ancient Hebrew prophets, but there is much in the book\nwhich Europeans usually regard as faulty. The tendency to repetition which is\nan inherent characteristic of the Semitic mind appears here in an exaggerated\nform, and there is in addition much in the Koran which strikes us as wild and\nfantastic. The</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">most unfavourable criticism ever passed on Muhammed's style\nhas in fact been penned by the prophet's greatest British admirer, Carlyle\nhimself; and there are probably many now who find themselves in the same\ndilemma with that great writer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The fault appears, however, to lie partly in our difficulty to appreciate the\npsychology of the Arab prophet. We must, in order to do him justice, give\nfull consideration to his temperament and to the condition of things around\nhim. We are here in touch with an untutored but fervent mind, trying to\nrealise itself and to assimilate certain great truths which have been\npowerfully borne in upon him, in order to impart them in a convincing form to\nhis fellow-tribesmen. He is surrounded by obstacles of every kind, yet he\nmanfully struggles on with the message that is within him. Learning he has\nnone, or next to none. His chief objects of knowledge are floating stories\nand traditions largely</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">picked up from hearsay, and his over-wrought mind is\nhis only teacher. The literary compositions to which he had ever listened\nwere the half-cultured, yet often wildly powerful rhapsodies of early Arabian\nminstrels, akin to Ossian rather than to anything else within our knowledge.\nWhat wonder then that his Koran took a form which to our colder temperaments\nsounds strange, unbalanced, and fantastic?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Yet the Moslems themselves consider the book the finest that ever appeared\namong men. They find no incongruity in the style. To them the matter is all\ntrue and the manner all perfect. Their eastern temperament responds readily\nto the crude, strong, and wild appeal which its cadences make to them, and\nthe jingling rhyme in which the sentences of a discourse generally end adds\nto the charm of the whole. The Koran, even if viewed from the point of view\nof style alone, was to them from the first nothing less than a miracle, as\ngreat</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a miracle as ever was wrought.</p><p>But to return to our own view of the case. Our difficulty in appreciating the\nstyle of the Koran even moderately is, of course, increased if, instead of\nthe original, we have a translation before us. But one is happy to be able to\nsay that Rodwell's rendering is one of the best that have as yet been\nproduced. It seems to a great extent to carry with it the atmosphere in which\nMuhammed lived, and its sentences are imbued with the flavour of the East.\nThe quasi-verse form, with its unfettered and irregular rhythmic flow of the\nlines, which has in suitable cases been adopted, helps to bring out much of\nthe wild charm of the Arabic. Not the least among its recommendations is,\nperhaps, that it is scholarly without being pedantic that is to say, that it\naims at correctness without sacrificing the right effect of the whole to\nover-insistence on small details.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Another important merit of Rodwell's edition is its</p>",

As he tells us himself in his preface, it is now in\na number of cases impossible to ascertain the exact occasion on which a\ndiscourse, or part of a discourse, was delivered, so that the system could\nnot be carried through with entire consistency. But the sequence adopted is\nin the main based on the best available historical and literary evidence; and\nin following the order of the chapters as here printed, the reader will be\nable to trace the development of the prophet's mind as he gradually advanced\nfrom the early flush of inspiration to the less spiritual and more equivocal\nr\\oc\\le of warrior, politician, and founder of an empire.</p><p>G.

It should be premised that their order as it stands in all Arabic\nmanuscripts, and in all hitherto printed editions, whether Arabic or\nEuropean, is not chronological, neither is there any authentic tradition to\nshew that it rests upon the authority of Muhammad himself. The scattered\nfragments of the Koran were in the first instance collected by his immediate\nsuccessor Abu Bekr, about a year after the Prophet's death, at the suggestion\nof Omar, who foresaw that, as the Muslim</p>",

Zaid Ibn\nTh�bit, a native of Medina, and one of the Ansars, or helpers, who had been\nMuhammad's amanuensis, was the person fixed upon to carry out the task, and\nwe are told that he \"gathered together\" the fragments of the Koran from every\nquarter, \"from date leaves and tablets of white stone, and from the breasts\nof men.\"1 The copy thus formed by Zaid probably remained in the possession of\nAbu Bekr during the remainder of his brief caliphate, who committed it to the\ncustody of Haphsa, one of Muhammad's widows, and this text continued during\nthe ten years of Omar's caliphate to be the standard. In the copies made from\nit, various readings naturally and necessarily sprung up; and these, under\nthe caliphate of</p>",

Copies of the text formed were thus\nforwarded to several of the chief military stations in the new empire, and\nall previously existing copies were committed to the flames.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Zaid and his coadjutors, however, do not appear to</p>",

Anything approaching to a chronological arrangement was entirely\nlost sight of. Late Medina Suras are often placed before early Meccan Suras;\nthe short Suras at the end of the Koran are its earliest portions; while, as\nwill be seen from the notes, verses of Meccan origin are to be found embedded\nin Medina Suras, and verses promulged at Medina scattered up and down in the\nMeccan Suras.

From the arrangement of this author I see no reason to depart\nin regard to the later Suras. It is based upon a searching criticism and\nminute analysis of the component verses of each, and may be safely taken as a\nstandard, which ought not to be departed from without weighty reasons. I\nhave, however, placed the earlier and more fragmentary Suras, after the two\nfirst, in an order which has reference rather to their subject matter than to\npoints of historical allusion, which in these Suras are very few; whilst on\nthe other hand, they are mainly couched in the language of self-communion, of\naspirations after truth, and of mental struggle, are vivid pictures of Heaven\nand Hell, or descriptions of natural objects, and refer also largely to the\nopposition met with by Muhammad from his townsmen of Mecca at the outset of\nhis public career.</p>",
