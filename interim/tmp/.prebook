    "innerHtml": "THE Koran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious\nbooks of the world. Though the youngest of the epoch-making works belonging\nto this class of literature, it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect\nwhich it has produced on large masses of men. It has created an all but new\nphase of human thought and a fresh type of character. It first transformed a\nnumber of heterogeneous desert tribes of the Arabian peninsula into a nation\nof heroes, and then proceeded to create the vast politico-religious\norganisations of the Muhammedan world which are one of the great forces with\nwhich Europe and the East have to reckon to-day."

    "innerHtml": "The secret of the power exercised by the book, of course, lay in the mind\nwhich produced it. It was, in fact, at first not a book, but a strong living\nvoice, a kind of wild authoritative proclamation, a series of admonitions,\npromises, threats, and instructions addressed to turbulent and largely\nhostile assemblies of untutored Arabs. As a book it was published after the\nprophet's death. In Muhammed's life-time there were only disjointed notes,\nspeeches, and the retentive memories of those who listened to them. To speak\nof the Koran is, therefore, practically the same as speaking of Muhammed, and\nin trying to appraise the religious value of the book one is at the same time\nattempting to form an opinion of the prophet himself. It would indeed be\ndifficult to find another case in which there is such a complete identity\nbetween the literary work and the mind of the man who produced it."

    "innerHtml": "That widely different estimates have been formed of Muhammed is well-known.\nTo Moslems he is, of course, the prophet par excellence, and the Koran is\nregarded by the orthodox as nothing less than the eternal utterance of Allah.\nThe eulogy pronounced by Carlyle on Muhammed in Heroes and Hero Worship will\nprobably be endorsed by not a few at the present day. The extreme contrary\nopinion, which in a fresh form has recently been revived1 by an able writer,\nis hardly likely to find much lasting support. The correct view very probably\nlies between the two extremes. The relative value of any given system of\nreligious thought must depend on the amount of truth which it embodies as\nwell as on the ethical standard which its adherents are bidden to follow.\nAnother important test is the degree of originality that is to be assigned to\nit, for it can manifestly only claim credit for that which is new in it, not\nfor that which it borrowed from other systems."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "With regard to the first-named criterion, there is a growing opinion among\nstudents of religious history that Muhammed may in a real sense be regarded\nas a prophet of certain truths, though by no means of truth in the absolute\nmeaning of the term. The shortcomings of the moral teaching contained in the\nKoran are striking enough if judged from the highest ethical standpoint with\nwhich we are acquainted; but a much more favourable view is arrived at if a\ncomparison is made between the ethics of the Koran and the moral tenets of\nArabian and other forms of heathenism which it supplanted."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "The method followed by Muhammed in the promulgation of the Koran also\nrequires to be treated with discrimination. From the first flash of prophetic\ninspiration which is clearly discernible in the earlier portions of the book\nhe, later on, frequently descended to deliberate invention and artful\nrhetoric. He, in fact, accommodated his moral sense to the circumstances in\nwhich the r\\oc\\le he had to play involved him."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "On the question of originality there can hardly be two opinions now that the\nKoran has been thoroughly compared with the Christian and Jewish traditions\nof the time; and it is, besides some original Arabian legends, to those only\nthat the book stands in any close relationship. The matter is for the most\npart borrowed, but the manner is all the prophet's own. This is emphatically\na case in which originality consists not so much in the creation of new\nmaterials of thought as in the manner in which existing traditions of various\nkinds are utilised and freshly blended to suit the special exigencies of the\noccasion. Biblical reminiscences, Rabbinic legends, Christian traditions\nmostly drawn from distorted apocryphal sources, and native heathen stories,\nall first pass through the prophet's fervid mind, and thence issue in strange\nnew forms, tinged with poetry and enthusiasm, and well adapted to enforce his\nown view of life and duty, to serve as an encouragement to his faithful\nadherents, and to strike terror into the hearts of his opponents."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "There is, however, apart from its religious value, a more general view from\nwhich the book should be considered. The Koran enjoys the distinction of\nhaving been the starting-point of a new literary and philosophical movement\nwhich has powerfully affected the finest and most cultivated minds among both\nJews and Christians in the Middle Ages. This general progress of the\nMuhammedan world has somehow been arrested, but research has shown that what\nEuropean scholars knew of Greek philosophy, of mathematics, astronomy, and\nlike sciences, for several centuries before the Renaissance, was, roughly\nspeaking, all derived from Latin treatises ultimately based on Arabic\noriginals; and it was the Koran which, though indirectly, gave the first\nimpetus to these studies among the Arabs and their allies. Linguistic\ninvestigations, poetry, and other branches of literature, also made their\nappearance soon after or simultaneously with the publication of the Koran;\nand the literary movement thus initiated has resulted in some of the finest\nproducts of genius and learning."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "The style in which the Koran is written requires some special attention in\nthis introduction. The literary form is for the most part different from\nanything else we know. In its finest passages we indeed seem to hear a voice\nakin to that of the ancient Hebrew prophets, but there is much in the book\nwhich Europeans usually regard as faulty. The tendency to repetition which is\nan inherent characteristic of the Semitic mind appears here in an exaggerated\nform, and there is in addition much in the Koran which strikes us as wild and\nfantastic. The most unfavourable criticism ever passed on Muhammed's style\nhas in fact been penned by the prophet's greatest British admirer, Carlyle\nhimself; and there are probably many now who find themselves in the same\ndilemma with that great writer."

  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "The fault appears, however, to lie partly in our difficulty to appreciate the\npsychology of the Arab prophet. We must, in order to do him justice, give\nfull consideration to his temperament and to the condition of things around\nhim. We are here in touch with an untutored but fervent mind, trying to\nrealise itself and to assimilate certain great truths which have been\npowerfully borne in upon him, in order to impart them in a convincing form to\nhis fellow-tribesmen. He is surrounded by obstacles of every kind, yet he\nmanfully struggles on with the message that is within him. Learning he has\nnone, or next to none. His chief objects of knowledge are floating stories\nand traditions largely picked up from hearsay, and his over-wrought mind is\nhis only teacher. The literary compositions to which he had ever listened\nwere the half-cultured, yet often wildly powerful rhapsodies of early Arabian\nminstrels, akin to Ossian rather than to anything else within our knowledge.\nWhat wonder then that his Koran took a form which to our colder temperaments\nsounds strange, unbalanced, and fantastic?"
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Yet the Moslems themselves consider the book the finest that ever appeared\namong men. They find no incongruity in the style. To them the matter is all\ntrue and the manner all perfect. Their eastern temperament responds readily\nto the crude, strong, and wild appeal which its cadences make to them, and\nthe jingling rhyme in which the sentences of a discourse generally end adds\nto the charm of the whole. The Koran, even if viewed from the point of view\nof style alone, was to them from the first nothing less than a miracle, as\ngreat a miracle as ever was wrought."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "But to return to our own view of the case. Our difficulty in appreciating the\nstyle of the Koran even moderately is, of course, increased if, instead of\nthe original, we have a translation before us. But one is happy to be able to\nsay that Rodwell's rendering is one of the best that have as yet been\nproduced. It seems to a great extent to carry with it the atmosphere in which\nMuhammed lived, and its sentences are imbued with the flavour of the East.\nThe quasi-verse form, with its unfettered and irregular rhythmic flow of the\nlines, which has in suitable cases been adopted, helps to bring out much of\nthe wild charm of the Arabic. Not the least among its recommendations is,\nperhaps, that it is scholarly without being pedantic that is to say, that it\naims at correctness without sacrificing the right effect of the whole to\nover-insistence on small details."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Another important merit of Rodwell's edition is its chronological arrangement\nof the Suras or chapters. As he tells us himself in his preface, it is now in\na number of cases impossible to ascertain the exact occasion on which a\ndiscourse, or part of a discourse, was delivered, so that the system could\nnot be carried through with entire consistency. But the sequence adopted is\nin the main based on the best available historical and literary evidence; and\nin following the order of the chapters as here printed, the reader will be\nable to trace the development of the prophet's mind as he gradually advanced\nfrom the early flush of inspiration to the less spiritual and more equivocal\nr\\oc\\le of warrior, politician, and founder of an empire."

    "innerHtml": "It is necessary that some brief explanation should be given with reference to\nthe arrangement of the Suras, or chapters, adopted in this translation of the\nKoran. It should be premised that their order as it stands in all Arabic\nmanuscripts, and in all hitherto printed editions, whether Arabic or\nEuropean, is not chronological, neither is there any authentic tradition to\nshew that it rests upon the authority of Muhammad himself. The scattered\nfragments of the Koran were in the first instance collected by his immediate\nsuccessor Abu Bekr, about a year after the Prophet's death, at the suggestion\nof Omar, who foresaw that, as the Muslim warriors, whose memories were the\nsole depositaries of large portions of the revelations, died off or were\nslain, as had been the case with many in the battle of Yem�ma, A.H. 12, the\nloss of the greater part, or even of the whole, was imminent. Zaid Ibn\nTh�bit, a native of Medina, and one of the Ansars, or helpers, who had been\nMuhammad's amanuensis, was the person fixed upon to carry out the task, and\nwe are told that he \"gathered together\" the fragments of the Koran from every\nquarter, \"from date leaves and tablets of white stone, and from the breasts\nof men.\"1 The copy thus formed by Zaid probably remained in the possession of\nAbu Bekr during the remainder of his brief caliphate, who committed it to the\ncustody of Haphsa, one of Muhammad's widows, and this text continued during\nthe ten years of Omar's caliphate to be the standard. In the copies made from\nit, various readings naturally and necessarily sprung up; and these, under\nthe caliphate of Othman, led to such serious disputes between the faithful,\nthat it became necessary to interpose, and in accordance with the warning of\nHodzeifa, \"to stop the people, before they should differ regarding their\nscriptures, as did the Jews and Christians.\"2 In accordance with this advice,\nOthman determined to establish a text which should be the sole standard, and\nentrusted the redaction to the Zaid already mentioned, with whom he\nassociated as colleagues, three, according to others, twelve3 of the\nKoreisch, in order to secure the purity of that Meccan idiom in which\nMuhammad had spoken, should any occasions arise in which the collators might\nhave to decide upon various readings. Copies of the text formed were thus\nforwarded to several of the chief military stations in the new empire, and\nall previously existing copies were committed to the flames."

    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Zaid and his coadjutors, however, do not appear to have arranged the\nmaterials which came into their hands upon any system more definite than that\nof placing the longest and best known Suras first, immediately after the\nFatthah, or opening chapter (the eighth in this edition); although even this\nrule, artless and unscientific as it is, has not been adhered to with\nstrictness. Anything approaching to a chronological arrangement was entirely\nlost sight of. Late Medina Suras are often placed before early Meccan Suras;\nthe short Suras at the end of the Koran are its earliest portions; while, as\nwill be seen from the notes, verses of Meccan origin are to be found embedded\nin Medina Suras, and verses promulged at Medina scattered up and down in the\nMeccan Suras. It would seem as if Zaid had to a great extent put his\nmaterials together just as they came to hand, and often with entire disregard\nto continuity of subject and uniformity of style. The text, therefore, as\nhitherto arranged, necessarily assumes the form of a most unreadable and\nincongruous patchwork; \"une assemblage,\" says M. Kasimirski in his Preface,\n\"informe et incoh�rent de pr�ceptes moraux, religieux, civils et politiques,\nm�l�s d'exhortations, de promesses, et de menaces\"-and conveys no idea\nwhatever of the development and growth of any plan in the mind of the founder\nof Islam, or of the circumstances by which he was surrounded and influenced.\nIt is true that the manner in which Zaid contented himself with simply\nbringing together his materials and transcribing them, without any attempt to\nmould them into shape or sequence, and without any effort to supply\nconnecting links between adjacent verses, to fill up obvious chasms, or to\nsuppress details of a nature discreditable to the founder of Islam, proves\nhis scrupulous honesty as a compiler, as well as his reverence for the sacred\ntext, and to a certain extent guarantees the genuineness and authenticity of\nthe entire volume. But it is deeply to be regretted that he did not combine\nsome measure of historical criticism with that simplicity and honesty of\npurpose which forbade him, as it certainly did, in any way to tamper with the\nsacred text, to suppress contradictory, and exclude or soften down\ninaccurate, statements."

Great attention has been paid to this subject by Dr. Weil in the\nwork just mentioned; by Mr. Muir in his Life of Mahomet, who also publishes a\nchronological list of Suras, 21 however of which he admits have \"not yet been\ncarefully fixed;\" and especially by N�ldeke, in his Geschichte des Q�rans, a\nwork to which public honours were awarded in 1859 by the Paris Academy of\nInscriptions. From the arrangement of this author I see no reason to depart\nin regard to the later Suras. It is based upon a searching criticism and\nminute analysis of the component verses of each, and may be safely taken as a\nstandard, which ought not to be departed from without weighty reasons. I\nhave, however, placed the earlier and more fragmentary Suras, after the two\nfirst, in an order which has reference rather to their subject matter than to\npoints of historical allusion, which in these Suras are very few; whilst on\nthe other hand, they are mainly couched in the language of self-communion, of\naspirations after truth, and of mental struggle, are vivid pictures of Heaven\nand Hell, or descriptions of natural objects, and refer also largely to the\nopposition met with by Muhammad from his townsmen of Mecca at the outset of\nhis public career.

It is\nquite possible that Muhammad himself, in a later period of his career,\ndesignedly mixed up later with earlier revelations in the same Suras not for\nthe sake of producing that mysterious style which seems so pleasing to the\nmind of those who value truth least when it is most clear and obvious but for\nthe purpose of softening down some of the earlier statements which represent\nthe last hour and awful judgment as imminent; and thus leading his followers\nto continue still in the attitude of expectation, and to see in his later\nsuccesses the truth of his earlier predictions. If after-thoughts of this\nkind are to be traced, and they will often strike the attentive reader, it\nthen follows that the perplexed state of the text in individual Suras is to\nbe considered as due to Muhammad himself, and we are furnished with a series\nof constant hints for attaining to chronological accuracy. And it may be\nremarked in passing, that a belief that the end of all things was at hand,\nmay have tended to promote the earlier successes of Islam at Mecca, as it\nunquestionably was an argument with the Apostles, to flee from \"the wrath to\ncome.\" It must be borne in mind that the allusions to contemporary minor\nevents, and to the local efforts made by the new religion to gain the\nascendant are very few, and often couched in terms so vague and general, that\nwe are forced to interpret the Koran solely by the Koran itself. And for\nthis, the frequent repetitions of the same histories and the same sentiments,\nafford much facility: and the peculiar manner in which the details of each\nhistory are increased by fresh traits at each recurrence, enables us to trace\ntheir growth in the author's mind, and to ascertain the manner in which a\npart of the Koran was composed. The absence of the historical element from\nthe Koran as regards the details of Muhammad's daily life, may be judged of\nby the fact, that only two of his contemporaries are mentioned in the entire\nvolume, and that Muhammad's name occurs but five times, although he is all\nthe way through addressed by the Angel Gabriel as the recipient of the divine\nrevelations, with the word SAY.

Syria. At a later period of his career no one would venture to doubt the\ndivine origin of the entire book. But at its commencement the case was\ndifferent. The people of Mecca spoke openly and tauntingly of it as the work\nof a poet, as a collection of antiquated or fabulous legends, or as palpable\nsorcery.4 They accused him of having confederates, and even specified\nforeigners who had been his coadjutors. Such were Salman the Persian, to whom\nhe may have owed the descriptions of Heaven and Hell, which are analogous to\nthose of the Zendavesta; and the Christian monk Sergius, or as the\nMuhammadans term him, Boheira. From the latter, and perhaps from other\nChristians, especially slaves naturalised at Mecca, Muhammad obtained access\nto the teaching of the Apocryphal Gospels, and to many popular traditions of\nwhich those Gospels are the concrete expression. His wife Chadijah, as well\nas her cousin Waraka, a reputed convert to Christianity, and Muhammad's\nintimate friend, are said to have been well acquainted with the doctrines and\nsacred books both of Jews and Christians. And not only were several Arab\ntribes in the neighbourhood of Mecca converts to the Christian faith, but on\ntwo occasions Muhammad had travelled with his uncle, Abu Talib, as far as\nBostra, where he must have had opportunities of learning the general outlines\nof Oriental Christian doctrine, and perhaps of witnessing the ceremonial of\ntheir worship. And it appears tolerably certain that previous to and at the\nperiod of his entering into public life, there was a large number of\nenquirers at Mecca, who like Zaid, Omayah of Taief, Waraka, etc., were\ndissatisfied equally with the religion of their fathers, the Judaism and the\nChristianity which they saw around them, and were anxiously enquiring for\nsome better way. The names and details of the lives of twelve of the\n\"companions\" of Muhammad who lived in Mecca, Medina, and Taief, are recorded,\nwho previous to his assumption of the Prophetic office, called themselves\nHanyfs, i.e., converts, puritans, and were believers in one God, and regarded\nAbraham as the founder of their religion.

In fact,\nwe have no historical authority for supposing that the doctrines of these\nheretics were taught or professed in Arabia at all.

But if, on the other hand, it was a\nBook carefully concocted from various sources, and with much extraneous aid,\nand published as a divine oracle, then it would seem that the author is at\nonce open to the charge of the grossest imposture, and even of impious\nblasphemy. The evidence rather shews, that in all he did and wrote, Muhammad\nwas actuated by a sincere desire to deliver his countrymen from the grossness\nof its debasing idolatries-that he was urged on by an intense desire to\nproclaim that great truth of the Unity of the Godhead which had taken full\npossession of his own soul-that the end to be attained justified to his mind\nthe means he adopted in the production of his Suras-that he worked himself up\ninto a belief that he had received a divine call-and that he was carried on\nby the force of circumstances, and by gradually increasing successes, to\nbelieve himself the accredited messenger of Heaven. The earnestness of those\nconvictions which at Mecca sustained him under persecution, and which perhaps\nled him, at any price as it were, and by any means, not even excluding deceit\nand falsehood, to endeavour to rescue his countrymen from idolatry,-naturally\nstiffened at Medina into tyranny and unscrupulous violence. At the same time,\nhe was probably, more or less, throughout his whole career, the victim of a\ncertain amount of self-deception. A cataleptic13 subject from his early\nyouth, born-according to the traditions-of a highly nervous and excitable\nmother, he would be peculiarly liable to morbid and fantastic hallucinations,\nand alternations of excitement and depression, which would win for him, in\nthe eyes of his ignorant countrymen, the credit of being inspired. It would\nbe easy for him to persuade himself that he was \"the seal of the Prophets,\"\nthe proclaimer of a doctrine of the Divine Unity, held and taught by the\nPatriarchs, especially by Abraham-a doctrine that should present to mankind\nJudaism divested of its Mosaic ceremonial, and Christianity divested of the\nAtonement and the Trinity14-doctrine, as he might have believed, fitted and\ndestined to absorb Judaism, Christianity, and Idolatry; and this persuasion,\nonce admitted into his mind as a conviction, retained possession of it, and\ncarried him on, though often in the use of means, towards the end of his\ncareer, far different from those with which he commenced it, to a victorious\nconsummation. It is true that the state of Arabia previous to the time of\nMuhammad was one of preparedness for a new religion that the scattered\nelements were there, and wanted only the mind of a master to harmonise and\nenforce them and that Islam was, so to speak, a necessity of the time.15\nStill Muhammad's career is a wonderful instance of the force and life that\nresides in him who possesses an intense Faith in God and in the unseen world;\nand whatever deductions may be made-and they are many and serious-from the\nnoble and truthful in his character, he will always be regarded as one of\nthose who have had that influence over the faith, morals, and whole earthly\nlife of their fellow-men, which none but a really great man ever did, or can,\nexercise; and as one of those, whose efforts to propagate some great verity\nwill prosper, in spite of manifold personal errors and defects, both of\nprinciple and character."

And thus, while\nthe Koran, which underlays this vast energy and contains the principles which\nare its springs of action, reflects to a great extent the mixed character of\nits author, its merits as a code of laws, and as a system of religious\nteaching, must always be estimated by the changes which it introduced into\nthe customs and beliefs of those who willingly or by compulsion embraced it.\nIn the suppression of their idolatries, in the substitution of the worship of\nAllah for that of the powers of nature and genii with Him, in the abolition\nof child murder, in the extinction of manifold superstitious usages, in the\nreduction of the number of wives to a fixed standard, it was to the Arabians\nan unquestionable blessing, and an accession, though not in the Christian\nsense a Revelation, of Truth; and while every Christian must deplore the\noverthrow of so many flourishing Eastern churches by the arms of the\nvictorious Muslims, it must not be forgotten that Europe, in the middle ages,\nowed much of her knowledge of dialectic philosophy, of medicine, and\narchitecture, to Arabian writers, and that Muslims formed the connecting link\nbetween the West and the East for the importation of numerous articles of\nluxury and use. That an immense mass of fable and silly legend has been built\nup upon the basis of the Koran is beyond a doubt, but for this Muhammad is\nnot answerable, any more than he is for the wild and bloodthirsty excesses of\nhis followers in after ages.

Profound meditation, the struggles of an earnest mind anxious to\nattain to truth, the morbid excitability of an epileptic subject, visions\nseen in epileptic swoons, disgust at Meccan idolatry, and a desire to teach\nhis countrymen the divine Unity will sufficiently account for the period of\nindecision termed the Fatrah, and for the determination which led Muhammad,\nin all sincerity, but still self-deceived, to take upon himself the office\nand work of a Messenger from God.

Stanley on I Cor. xi. 10),\nto envelope him in his mantle; that then Gabriel came down and addressed him\nas in v. I.  This vision, like that which preceded Sura xcvi., may actually\nhave occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits from\nwhich Muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered.  Hence Muhammad in\nSura lxxxi. appeals to it as a matter of fact, and such he doubtless believe\nit to be.  It may here be observed, that however absurd the Muslim traditions\nmay be in many of their details, it will generally be found that where there\nis an ancient and tolerably universal consent, there will be found at the\nbottom a residuum of fact and historical truth.

And it can\nscarcely be an accidental circumstance that the words of the first, second,\nand fifth verses do not occur in any other Suras of the first Meccan period\nas given by N�ldeke, but frequently in those of the second, which it\ntherefore, in N�ldeke, opinion, immediately precedes. But this may be\naccounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private and\npublic devotion by Muhammad himself, which is the meaning probably of the\nMuhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice.  It should also be observed\nthat, including the auspicatory formula, there are the same number of\npetitions in this Sura as in the Lord's Prayer. It is recited several times\nin each of the five daily prayers, and on many other occassions, as in\nconcluding a bargain, etc. It is termed \"the Opening of the Book,\" \"the\nCompletion,\" \"the Sufficing Sura,\" the Sura of Praise, Thanks, and Prayer,\"\n\"the Healer,\" \"the Remedy,\" \"the Basis,\" \"the Treasure,\" \"the Mother of the\nBook,\" \"the Seven Verses of Repetition.\" The Muhammadans always say \"Amen\"\nafter this prayer, Muhammad having been instructed, says the Sonna, to do so\nby the Angel Gabriel."
